This is the repository for the main site. Developers and designers should build it on the required design platform then drop the HTML and assets here, then deploy.

### Purpose
Using GitHub saves the hassle of dealing with SSL issues related to other platforms, and one can even refactor the code with things not native to other platforms, such as different fonts.
